# Documentation Overview

This Sphinx site focuses on the programmatic surface of Responsive Fine-Tuner.

## Structure
- **Quick Tour** — recap the main entry points (`run_app.py`, Gradio interface, and Streamlit enterprise launcher).
- **API Reference** — autogenerated stubs for backend and frontend modules so engineers can import RFT inside their own pipelines.

## Building the Docs
```bash
cd docs/api
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
make html
```

The generated site will live under `_build/html/index.html`. Host it with GitHub Pages, Netlify, or as part of your internal developer portal.
