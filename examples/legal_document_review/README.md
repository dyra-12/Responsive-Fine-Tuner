# Legal Document Review Example

This example contains contract clauses with review statuses. Fine-tune RFT to highlight risky language by providing quick corrections.

- `sample.csv` columns: `clause`, `status` (`Approved`, `Needs Review`).
- Use feedback to teach the model to surface riskier phrasing before a human reviewer.
