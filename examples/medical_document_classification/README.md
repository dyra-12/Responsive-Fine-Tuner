# Medical Document Classification Example

Simulated clinical summaries with diagnostic labels. Each row describes a note snippet plus an accompanying category.

- `sample.txt`: one note per paragraph. Use the labeling tab to assign classes like `Diagnosis` or `Treatment`.
- Add `metadata.json` for patient-level context if desired.
